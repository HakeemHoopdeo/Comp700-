Open up the project in Intellij IDEA.
For simplicity, the CustomAI Algorithms are all runnable classes.
You can run LeftOnly, RightOnly and Mirror separately as they all have main methods.

There are two more classes that were used during development for player vs AI:
C4MiniMaxPlayerAI.java and C4MCSTPlayerAI.java 
Both of which allows you to play against the different AI algorithms.
The MiniMax displays the board upside down - this was irrelevant as I was not using it for testing.

The core class required for this project is MCSTvMiniMax:
That's where the magic happens between the AI. There are three variables that you can control:
-noOfGames
-miniMaxDepth
-monteCarloTime
These are parameters that you can tweak to change the performance of the AI.
